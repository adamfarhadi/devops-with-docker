For exercise 2.11 I decided to containerize the phonebook application from Full Stack Open part 3. Both the frontend and the backend have their own dockerfiles and the ports and images are specified in `docker-compose.yml`. The database is running in the cloud so users need to specify their own `MONGODB_URI` in the backend `Dockerfile`. Another option is to containerize the MongoDB database as well.

For this exercise (3.11) I used the material from part 3 of this course to decrease the sizes of the docker images. Here are the sizes I ended up with:

phonebook-frontend before: 1.1GB
phonebook-frontend after: 122GB
phonebook-backend before: 934MB
phonebook-backend after: 143MB
