For exercise 2.11 I decided to containerize the phonebook application from Full Stack Open part 3. Both the frontend and the backend have their own dockerfiles and the ports and images are specified in `docker-compose.yml`. The database is running in the cloud so users need to specify their own `MONGODB_URI` in the backend `Dockerfile`. Another option is to containerize the MongoDB database as well.
